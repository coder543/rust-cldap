description = "Straightforward Rust bindings to the C openldap library. This is a fork of cldap that has been methodically fixed, extended, and made to be more compliant with openldap. It should be relatively robust and production ready at this point. Not heavily maintained, but feel free to send PRs if you see something missing."
